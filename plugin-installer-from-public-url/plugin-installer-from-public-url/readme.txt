Plugin allows you to install any plugin from a URL. All you need to do is to insert a specific URL and click the Install button. No need to download and upload archive anymore.

== Description ==

If you are a developer and want your customers to install plugins from your site without downloading and uploading them manually - just install our plugin and provide the URL. If you are a website administrator and you buy third-party plugins from developers - you can use our plugin for quick and easy installation. Just ask the developer for a link and past it into URL field.

**Install Plugin From URL**
You can easily let your customers install all your plugins right from their website administrator area.  When a user goes into his/her backend and click on the "Install from Web" tab, your extension can be found and the "Install" button appears, so the user can just click to install your extension.

**Legal Notice**
Plugin Installer from public URL is great for many reasons: it makes it easier for users to find and install extensions outside WordPress, and it helps support the development of a vibrant and healthy commercial and non-commercial development community around WordPress. However, it may also be unintentionally undermining our support of the GPL by including extensions and other applications that run counter to it. So itâ€™s yours responsibility to make sure the plugin you would like to install does not break any WP rules and does not contain backdoors, viruses, or malware.

**Main Features**

* Install from any URL
* No coding required
* One-click installation
* Create your own repository for your customers
* No need to download and upload archive

PLEASE NOTE: To avoid any security issues with your website, make sure that you install 3rd party plugins from trusted resources only. Don't install nulled plugins, plugins from "free stuff" websites and from any other illegal site or sites with illegal activity.
